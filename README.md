# Information about this Project

**Creation Date: 6th September, 2023**

Repository to track my python learning journey. Hopefully, it can record my zero-to-hero journey properly, tho!

## Okay, why am I here, tho??

Well, my college is asking us to work on some group projects using python. And I am like, okay why not? I have been avoiding to use Python for most of my life for some complicated reasons that is a bit hard to explain (too lazy, lah). Since I have to use it anyways in the future for my AI career, I might as well record my journey.

## Okay, what do I want to learn?

- Python (OF COURSE)
- DSA + CodeWars

## The Journey

This section of the document will be updated to reflect my learning journey.
